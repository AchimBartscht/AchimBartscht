# Hi from Hamburg ðŸ‘‹ 
my name is Achim and I live with my family in Hamburg in the north of germany. I am going to start a new career as a Web Developer. Therefore I become a member of a **Neue Fische IT-Bootcamp**. One of my hobbies is motorcycling. Take a look on my old beemer: ![My old beemer](https://maschinistenundsoehne.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/BMW_1.jpg))

I had to refresh a lot of the parts of the old motorcycle. For example:
- new cylinders,
- new wheels,
- new tank,
- new color
  and a lot more.
  But now itÂ´s real fun to drive.

## What I am currently learning
