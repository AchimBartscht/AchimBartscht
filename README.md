### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
IÂ´m Achim from Hamburg and IÂ´m going to start a new career as a Web Developer. Because of that I become a member of Neue Fische IT-Bootcamp in may 2023.

One of my hobbies is motorcycling. Please take a look on my fine old BMW.

This old **Beemer** was built in 1977. I had to overhaul 
- cylinders
- cylinderheads
- tank
- seat

All in all itÂ´s a smooth running classic bike now.
