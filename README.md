# Moin from Hamburg
my name is Achim and I live with my family in hamburg in germany. I will start a new career as Web Developer. Therefore I become a member of an IT-Bootcamp from Neue Fische. One of my hobbies is motorcycling. Take a look on my old beemer: 

I had to refresh a lot of the parts of the old bike
- new cylinders,
- new wheels,
- new tank,
- new color
  and so on. But now itÂ´s a blast to drive.
