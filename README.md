## Hi from Hamburg ðŸ‘‹ 
my name is Achim and I live with my family in the beautiful port city in the north of germany. After 20 years of working in companies I founded myself, I would like to try something new again. As a web developer, I can add new skills to my online experiences. That's why I became a member of a **Neue Fische IT-Bootcamp - Web Development**. 

## What they tried to teach me

Web development, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Next.js, MongoDB, Fuse.js, Chart.js, Agile methods, Scrum
