# Moin from Hamburg
my name is Achim and I live with my family in hamburg in germany. I am going to start a new career as Web Developer. Therefore I become a member of a **Neue Fische IT-Bootcamp**. One of my hobbies is motorcycling. Take a look on my old beemer: ![My old beemer](https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/moto_gallery/BMW-R-60-7-10883_2.jpg)

I had to refresh a lot of the parts of the old motorcycle. For example:
- new cylinders,
- new wheels,
- new tank,
- new color
  and a lot more. But now itÂ´s real fun to drive.
