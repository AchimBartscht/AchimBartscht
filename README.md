## Hi from Hamburg ðŸ‘‹ 
my name is Achim and I live with my family in the port city in the north of germany. I am going to start a new career as a Web Developer. That's why I became a member of a **Neue Fische IT-Bootcamp**. One of my hobbies is motorcycling. Take a look at my old BMW from 1977: ![My old beemer](https://maschinistenundsoehne.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/BMW_1.jpg))

I had to restore a lot of the parts of the old motorcycle. For example:
- new cylinders,
- new ignition,
- new wheels,
- new paintwork (and a lot more).

  But now itÂ´s real fun to drive. You will find some more details about this bike on my motorcycle website [Maschinisten & Soehne](https://maschinistenundsoehne.de/blog/bmw-motorrad-baureihe-7)
